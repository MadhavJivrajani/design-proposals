# Multi-fields Merge Key in Strategic Merge Patch

## Abstract

Support multi-fields merge key in Strategic Merge Patch.

## Background

Strategic Merge Patch is covered in this [doc](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/strategic-merge-patch.md).
In Strategic Merge Patch, we use Merge Key to identify the entries in the list of non-primitive types.
It must always be present and unique to perform the merge on the list of non-primitive types,
and will be preserved.

The merge key exists in the struct tag (e.g. in [types.go](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/5a9759b0b41d5e9bbd90d5a8f3a4e0a6c0b23b47/pkg/api/v1/types.go#L2831))
and the [OpenAPI spec](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/api/openapi-spec/swagger.json).

## Motivation

The current implementation only support a single field as merge key.
For some element Kinds, the identity is actually defined using multiple fields.
[Service port](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/39188) is an evidence indicating that
we need to support multi-fields Merge Key.

## Scope

This proposal only covers how we introduce ability to support multi-fields merge key for strategic merge patch.
It will cover how we support new APIs with multi-fields merge key.

This proposal does NOT cover how we change the merge keys from one single field to multi-fields
for existing APIs without breaking backward compatibility,
e.g. we are not addressing the service port issue mentioned above.
That part will be addressed by [#476](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/pull/476).

## Proposed Change

### API Change

If a merge key has multiple fields, it will be a string of merge key fields seperated by ",", i.e. `patchMergeKey:"<key1>,<key2>,<key3>"`.

If a merge key only has one field, it will be the same as before, i.e. `patchMergeKey:"<key1>"`.

There are no patch format changes.
Additional fields are just extra fields in the patch.

E.g.
foo and bar are the merge keys.

Live list:
```yaml
list:
- foo: a
  bar: x
  other: 1
- foo: a
  bar: y
  other: 2
- foo: b
  bar: x
  other: 3
```

Patch 1:
```yaml
list:
- foo: a # field 1 of merge key
  bar: x # field 2 of merge key
  other: 4
  another: val
```

Result after merging patch 1:
```yaml
list:
- foo: a
  bar: x
  other: 4
  another: val
- foo: a
  bar: y
  other: 2
- foo: b
  bar: x
  other: 3
```

Patch 2:
```yaml
list:
- $patch: delete
  foo: a # field 1 of merge key
  bar: x # field 2 of merge key
```

Result after merging patch 2:
```yaml
list:
- foo: a
  bar: y
  other: 2
- foo: b
  bar: x
  other: 3
```

### Strategic Merge Patch pkg

We will add logic to support
- returning a list of fields instead of one single field when looking up merge key.
- merging list respecting a list of fields as merge key.

### Open API

Open API will not be affected,
since multi-fields merge key is still in one single string as an extension in Open API spec.

### Docs

Document that the developer should make sure the merge key can uniquely identify an entry in all cases.

## Version Skew and Backward Compatibility

It is fully backward compatibility,
because there are no patch format changes and no changes to the existing APIs.
