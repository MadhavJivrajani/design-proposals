# Title

This is the title of the KEP.
Keep it simple and descriptive.
A good title can help communicate what the KEP is and should be considered as part of any review.

The *filename* for the KEP should include the KEP number along with the title.
The title should be lowercased and spaces/punctuation should be replaced with `-`.
As the KEP is approved and an official KEP number is allocated, the file should be renamed.

To get started with this template:
* Make a copy in the appropriate directory.
  Name it `draft-YYYYMMDD-my-title.md`.
* Create a PR in the [`kubernetes/community`](https://github.com/kubernetes/community) repo.
* Check in early.
  Do this once the document holds together and general direction is understood by many in the sponsoring SIG.
  View anything marked as a draft as a working document.
  Aim for single topic PRs to keep discussions focused.
  If you disagree with what is already in a document, open a new PR with suggested changes.
* As a KEP is approved, rename the file yet again with the final KEP number.

The canonical place for the latest set of instructions (and the likely source of this file) is [here](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/design-proposals/architecture/0000-kep-template.md).

## Metadata (remove this)

The `Metadata` section is intended to support the creation of tooling around the KEP process.
This will be a YAML section that is fenced as a code block.

See the KEP process for details on each of these items.
This is here for easy copy/pasting.

## Table of Contents

A table of contents is helpful for quickly jumping to sections of a KEP and for highlighting any additional information provided beyond the standard KEP template.
[Tools for generating][] a table of contents from markdown are available.

## Summary

The `Summary` section is incredibly important for producing high quality user focused documentation such as release notes or a development road map.
It should be possible to collect this information before implementation begins in order to avoid requiring implementors to split their attention between writing release notes and implementing the feature itself.
KEP editors, SIG Docs, and SIG PM should help to ensure that the tone and content of the `Summary` section is useful for a wide audience.

A good summary is probably at least a paragraph in length.

## Motivation

The `Motivation` section should describe

- why we believe this change is important
- what benefits are expected to be realized from the change
- the high level design goals

The `Motivation` section is important for getting all responsible parties to understand the intention behind a change.
The motivation section can optionally provide links to [experience reports][] to demonstrate the interest in a KEP within the wider Kubernetes community.

## Guide-level Explanation [optional]

Merging a change to source control is a crucial, but not final, milestone in the implementation of a KEP.
Enhancements need to be explained to the Kubernetes community.
The `Guide-level Explaination` section should be used to explain a KEP to another Kubernaut after implementation.
Excellent guidance can be found in the Rust RFC [guide-level explanation][] instructions.

## Reference-level explanation

Before submitting a detailed implementation plan, a KEP author might begin the `Reference-level Explaination` by sketching high level design goals and any mandatory requirements.

Communicating dependencies across multiple SIGs is an important use for KEPs.
Explaining how a KEP interacts with other KEPs and existing Kubernetes functionality should be included in this section.

The `Reference-level explaination` section should ideally contain enough information for someone besides the author to begin working on an implementation of the KEP.
In a similar manner to the guidance on [implementing an RFC][] from the Rust community, not all KEPs must be implemented immediately.
Associating each KEP with one or more issues filed against Kubernetes repositories allows interested community members to track implementation.

Excellent guidance can be found in the Rust RFC [reference-level explanation][] instructions.

## Graduation Criteria

Gathering user feedback is crucial for building high quality experiences and SIGs have the important responsibility of setting milestones for stability and completeness.
Hopefully the content previously contained in [umbrella issues][] will be tracked in the `Graduation Criteria` section.

[umbrella issues]: https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/42752

## Implementation History

Major milestones in the life cycle of a KEP should be tracked in `Implementation History`.
Major milestones might include

- the `Summary` and `Motivation` sections being merged signaling SIG acceptance
- the `Detailed Design` section being merged signaling agreement on a proposed design
- the date implementation started
- the first Kubernetes release where an initial version of the KEP was available
- the version of Kubernetes where the KEP graduated to general availability
- when the KEP was retired or superseded

## Drawbacks [optional]

Why should this KEP _not_ be implemented.

## Alternatives [optional]

Similar to the `Drawbacks` section the `Alternatives` section is used to highlight and record other possible approaches to delivering the value proposed by a KEP.

## Unresolved Questions [optional]

The `Unresolved Questions` section is used to parking lot issues not ready to be addressed before implementation begins.

## Mentors [optional]

Mentors who can help a community member implement a KEP which follows its `Detailed Design` are crucial to scaling the Kubernetes project.
Potential mentors can list their contact information using their preferred contact information in the `Mentors` section.
