# Overview

The `/etc/resolv.conf` in a pod is managed by Kubelet and its contents are
generated based on `pod.dnsPolicy`. For `dnsPolicy: Default`, the `search` and
`nameserver` fields are taken from the `resolve.conf` on the node where the pod
is running. If the `dnsPolicy` is `ClusterFirst`, the search contents of the
resolv.conf is the hosts `resolv.conf` augmented with the following options:

*   Search paths to add aliases for domain names in the same namespace and
    cluster suffix.
*   `options ndots` to 5 to ensure the search paths are searched for all
    potential matches.

The configuration of both search paths and `ndots` results in query
amplification of five to ten times for non-cluster internal names. This is due
to the fact that each of the search path expansions must be tried before the
actual result is found. This order of magnitude increase of query rate imposes a
large load on the kube-dns service. At the same time, there are user
applications do not need the convenience of the name aliases and do not wish to
pay this performance cost.


## Existing workarounds

The current work around for this problem is to specify an FQDN for name
resolution. Any domain name that ends with a period (e.g. `foo.bar.com.`) will
not be search path expanded. However, use of FQDNs is not well-known practice
and imposes application-level changes. Cluster operators may not have the luxury
of enforcing such a change to applications that run on their infrastructure.

It is also possible for the user to insert a short shell script snippet that
rewrites `resolv.conf` on container start-up. This has the same problems as the
previous approach and is also awkward for the user. This also forces the
container to have additional executable code such as a shell or scripting engine
which increases the applications security surface area.


# Proposal sketch

Add a new `pod.dnsPolicy: Custom` that allows for user customization of
`resolv.conf`.


## Pod API example

In the example below, the user wishes to add the pod namespace and a custom
expansion to the search path, as they do not use the other name aliases:

```yaml
# Pod spec
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  namespace: ns1
  name: example
spec:
  containers:
  - name: example
    image: example
  dnsPolicy: Custom
  dnsParams:
    custom:
      search:
      - $(NAMESPACE).svc.$(CLUSTER)
      - my.dns.search.suffix
      - $(HOST)
      options:
      - "ndots:2"
```

Given the following host `/etc/resolv.conf`:

```bash
nameserver 1.2.3.4
search foo.com bar.com
options ndots:1
```

The pod will get the following `/etc/resolv.conf`:

```bash
nameserver 10.240.0.10
# Comments only for explication purposes.
#
#      $(NAMESPACE).svc.$CLUSTER
#      |                     my.dns.search.suffix
#      |                     |                    $(HOST)
#      |                     |                    |
#      V                     V                    V
search ns1.svc.cluster.local my.dns.search.suffix foo.com bar.com
# Populated from custom.options
options ndots:2
```

## More examples

The following is a Pod dnsParams that only contains the host search paths:

```yaml
dnsParams:
  custom:
    searchPaths:
    - $HOST
```

Override `ndots` and add custom search path. Note that overriding the ndot may
break the functionality of some of the search paths the

```yaml
dnsParams:
  custom:
    searchPaths:
    - my.custom.suffix
    - $HOST
    options:
    - "ndots:3"
```

# API changes

```go
type PodSpec struct {
	...
	DNSPolicy string
	DNSParams *PodDNSParams
    ...
}

type PodDNSParams struct {
 	Custom PodDNSParamsCustom
}

type PodDNSParamsCustom struct {
	Search []string
 	Options []string
}

// This will not appear in types.go but is here for explication purposes.
type DNSParamsSubstitution string
const (
	DNSParamsSearchPathNamespace = "$(NAMESPACE)"
	DNSParamsSearchPathClusterDomain = "$(CLUSTER)"
	DNSParamsSearchPathHostPaths = "$(HOST)"
)
```

## Semantics
### searchPath

If `dnsPolicy: Custom` is used, then the `search` line will be constructed from
the entries listed in `dnsParams.custom.search`:

```go
// Note: pseudocode does not include input validation.
func SearchPath(params *PodDNSParams) []string {
	var searchPaths []string
	for _, entry := range params.SearchPaths {
		if entry == "$HOST" {
			searchPaths = append(searchPaths, HostSearchPaths...)
			break
		}
		searchPaths = append(searchPaths, expand(entry))
	}
	return searchPaths
}

func expand(s string) string {
	labels := strings.Split(s, ".")
	for i := range labels {
		if labels[0] == "$" {
			labels[i] = Substitute(labels[i])
		}
	}
	return strings.Join(labels, ".")
}

var LabelSubstitutions map[string]string

func Substitute(l label) string {
  if s, ok := LabelSubstitutions[l]; ok {
    return s
  }
  return l
}
```

#### Substitutions

`Substitute` will replace DNS labels that begin with `$` with values for the
given Pod. Note: the DNS label MUST be an EXACT string match. E.g. if the pod
namespace is `my-ns`, `abc$(NAMESPACE)1234` will NOT be expanded to
`abcmy-ns1234`, but will be an invalid configuration.

| Substitution | Description |
| ----   | ---- |
| `$(NAMESPACE)` | Namespace of the Pod |
| `$(CLUSTER)` | Kubernetes cluster domain (e.g. `cluster.local`) |
| `$(HOST)` | Host search paths. This is a special substitution that MUST ONLY appear at the end of the `searchPaths` list |

### options

Each element of options will be copied unmodified as an options line.

### Invalid configurations

The follow configurations will result in an invalid Pod spec:

*  An invalid domain name/substitution appears in `searchPaths`.
*  `dnsParams` is MUST be empty unless `dnsPolicy: Custom` is used.
*   Number of final search paths exceeds 5 (glibc limit).
*  `$HOST` is not the last item in `searchPaths`.
*  `ndots` is greater than 15 (glibc limit).
