## Abstract

Describes a proposal for a new volume type that can project secrets,
configmaps, and downward API items.

## Motivation

Users often need to build directories that contain multiple types of
configuration and secret data. For example, a configuration directory for some
software package may contain both config files and credentials. Currently, there
is no way to achieve this in Kubernetes without scripting inside of a container.

## Constraints and Assumptions

1.  The volume types must remain unchanged for backward compatibility
2.  There will be a new volume type for this proposed functionality, but no
    other API changes
3.  The new volume type should support atomic updates in the event of an input
    change

## Use Cases

1.  As a user, I want to automatically populate a single volume with the keys
    from multiple secrets, configmaps, and with downward API information, so
    that I can synthesize a single directory with various sources of
    information
2.  As a user, I want to populate a single volume with the keys from multiple
    secrets, configmaps, and with downward API information, explicitly
    specifying paths for each item, so that I can have full control over the
    contents of that volume

### Populating a single volume without pathing

A user should be able to map any combination of resources mentioned above into a
single directory. There are plenty of examples of software that needs to be
configured both with config files and secret data. The combination of having
that data not only accessible, but in the same location provides for an easier
user experience.

### Populating a single volume with pathing

Currently it is possible to define the path within a volume for specific
resources. Therefore the same is true for each resource contained within the
new single volume.

## Current State Overview

The only way of utilizing secrets, configmaps, and downward API (while
maintaining atomic updates) currently is to access the data using separate mount
paths as shown in the volumeMounts section below:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: volume-test
spec:
  containers:
  - name: container-test
    image: busybox
    volumeMounts:
    - name: mysecret
      mountPath: "/secrets"
      readOnly: true
    - name: podInfo
      mountPath: "/podinfo"
      readOnly: true
    - name: config-volume
      mountPath: "/config"
      readOnly: true
  volumes:
  - name: mysecret
    secret:
      secretName: jpeeler-db-secret
      items:
        - key: username
          path: my-group/my-username
  - name: podInfo
    downwardAPI:
      items:
        - path: "labels"
          fieldRef:
            fieldPath: metadata.labels
        - path: "annotations"
          fieldRef:
            fieldPath: metadata.annotations
  - name: config-volume
    configMap:
      name: special-config
      items:
        - key: special.how
          path: path/to/special-key
```

## Analysis

There are several combinations of resources that can be used at once, which
all warrant consideration. The combinations are listed with one instance of
each resource, but real world usage will support multiple instances of a
specific resource too. Each example was written with the expectation that all
of the resources are to be projected to the same directory (or with the same
non-root parent), though it is not strictly required.

### ConfigMap + Secrets + Downward API

The user wishes to deploy containers with configuration data that includes
passwords. An application using these resources could be deploying OpenStack
on Kubernetes. The configuration data may need to be assembled differently
depending on if the services are going to be used for production or for
testing. If a pod is labeled with production or testing, the downward API
selector metadata.labels can be used to produce the correct OpenStack configs.

### ConfigMap + Secrets

Again, the user wishes to deploy containers involving configuration data and
passwords. This time the user is executing an Ansible playbook stored as a
configmap, with some sensitive encrypted tasks that are decrypted using a vault
password file.

### ConfigMap + Downward API

In this case, the user wishes to generate a config including the podâ€™s name
(available via the metadata.name selector). This application may then pass the
pod name along with requests in order to easily determine the source without
using IP tracking.

### Secrets + Downward API

A user may wish to use a secret as a public key to encrypt the namespace of
the pod (available via the metadata.namespace selector). This example may be
the most contrived, but perhaps the operator wishes to use the application to
deliver the namespace information securely without using an encrypted
transport.

### Collisions between keys when configured paths are identical

In the event the user specifies any keys with the same path, the pod spec will
not be accepted as valid. Note the specified path for mysecret and myconfigmap
are the same:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: volume-test
spec:
  containers:
  - name: container-test
    image: busybox
    volumeMounts:
    - name: all-in-one
      mountPath: "/projected-volume"
      readOnly: true
  volumes:
  - name: all-in-one
    projected:
      sources:
      - secret:
          name: mysecret
          items:
            - key: username
              path: my-group/data
      - configMap:
          name: myconfigmap
          items:
            - key: config
              path: my-group/data
```


### Collisions between keys without configured paths

The only run time validation can occur is when all the paths are known at pod
creation, similar to the above scenario. Otherwise, when a conflict occurs the
most recent specified resource will overwrite anything preceding it (this is
true for resources that are updated after pod creation as well).

### Collisions when one path is explicit and the other is automatically projected

In the event that there is a collision due to a user specified path matching
data that is automatically projected, the latter resource will overwrite
anything preceding it as before.

## Code changes

### Proposed API objects

```go
type ProjectedVolumeSource struct {
    Sources           []VolumeProjection `json:"sources"`
    DefaultMode       *int32             `json:"defaultMode,omitempty"`
}

type VolumeProjection struct {
    Secret      *SecretProjection      `json:"secret,omitempty"`
    ConfigMap   *ConfigMapProjection   `json:"configMap,omitempty"`
    DownwardAPI *DownwardAPIProjection `json:"downwardAPI,omitempty"`
}

type SecretProjection struct {
    LocalObjectReference
    Items []KeyToPath
    Optional *bool
}

type ConfigMapProjection struct {
    LocalObjectReference
    Items []KeyToPath
    Optional *bool
}

type DownwardAPIProjection struct {
    Items []DownwardAPIVolumeFile
}
```

### Additional required modifications

Add to the VolumeSource struct:

```go
Projected *ProjectedVolumeSource `json:"projected,omitempty"`
// (other existing fields omitted for brevity)
```

The appropriate conversion code would need to be generated for v1, validations
written, and the new volume plugin code produced as well.

## Examples

      readOnly: true
  volumes:
  - name: all-in-one
    projected:
      sources:
      - secret:
          name: mysecret
